# Enhancement of Images using SRCNN

This repository contains code for enhancing images using the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN).

## About

The **Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN)** is a deep learning model designed to perform single image super-resolution, enhancing the quality of images by generating high-resolution versions from low-resolution inputs.

## Colab Notebook

The implementation and demonstration of the SRCNN model can be found in the Colab notebook: [srcnn_enhancement.ipynb](srcnn_enhancement.ipynb).

The Notebook contains the code, explanations, and results related to the Enhancement of Images task using SRCNN.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be accessed from the following link: [SRCNN Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html).

The dataset files are stored in the **[Data set](Data%20set)** folder in this repository.
